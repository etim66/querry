### Contribution
We welcome contributions to Querry! Whether you're adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or improving documentation, your help is greatly appreciated. Here are some guidelines to help make the contribution process smooth:

#### Before Submitting a Pull Request (PR):

1. Discuss New Features: If your contribution involves a significant change or new feature, please open an issue first to discuss its feasibility and implementation details before creating a PR. This helps ensure that your work aligns with the project's direction.
2. Keep Submissions Focused: For easier review, please limit the scope of your PRs to small, well-defined changes. Aim for PRs under 800 lines whenever possible. Larger contributions can be broken down into smaller, self-contained units.

#### Additional Guidelines:
1. Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and formatting conventions.
2. Write clear and concise commit messages that describe your changes.
3. Include relevant tests for any bug fixes or new features.
4. By contributing, you agree to your submitted code being released under the MIT license.


### Security Vulnerabilities
Security vulnerabilities are a serious concern. If you discover a potential security issue, please do not create a public issue report. Instead, use the confidential reporting feature provided by GitHub, ensuring the details remain private until a fix is released. You can find instructions on privately reporting vulnerabilities here: [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
